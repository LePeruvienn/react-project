					Fabiola Pinel's novel reveals the hidden―and most human―side of political violence: the reasons why young people from Lima joined the cause and struggle of the Shining Path. It narrates their dilemmas, challenges, hopes, and disillusions through the youthful face of a woman. From the outskirts of the capital, they progressively commit to the cause while dealing with their everyday lives; they, too, will not escape the horrors they will endure for taking on this existential ideological stance. It offers a perspective that seeks to understand, not justify, and in doing so, helps build bridges between Peruvians.
